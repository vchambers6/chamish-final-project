# Giants - CS175 Final Project
Final Project for Harvard CS 175 (Computer Graphics) by Julia Kennish & Vanessa Chambers

For our final project "Giants" we aimed to simulate features of rigid bodies and joint hierarchies through a simple game of figures spinning around a horizontal bar, akin to gymnasts during an uneven bar event doing "giants." We implemented this game through the use of custom humanoid models and C\# scripts to simulate swinging movement. Specifically, we want to examine the differences between the origination point of the force in the motion, and whether or not this aligns with what is most physically advantageous for gymnasts in real life.

Our pdf write-up is also included in this repo.

# Controls
Controls are explained on our start page, but to reiterate them:

Holding Z, X, C and/or V while using the left and right arrow keys will move the respective figures in the +/-z direction.

Pressing "space" will release all of the figures from the bar.

Pressing "M" will return you to the menu, pressing "R" will reset the scene.

# Executables
Please download our full repo to test our final product.

To find our Windows executable please navigate through this repo My Project > Windows Build > Giants > My Project.exe

To find our Mac executable please navigate through this repo My Project > Mac Build (on a mac this should appear as a single application)

Some permissions may need to be bypassed in order to execute our project. We have tested the project on both Mac and Windows computers (and both execute as expected), please reach out to us if the code does not execute as indicated in the write-up.

# We hope you enjoy playing!
