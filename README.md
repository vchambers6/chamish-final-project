# Giants - CS175 Final Project
Final Project for Harvard CS 175 (Computer Graphics) by Julia Kennish & Vanessa Chambers

For our final project ``Giants'' we aimed to simulate features of rigid bodies and joint hierarchies through a simple game of figures spinning around a horizontal bar, akin to gymnasts during an uneven bar event doing ``giants.'' We implemented this game through the use of custom humanoid models and C\# scripts to simulate swinging movement. Specifically, we want to examine the differences between the origination point of the force in the motion, and whether or not this aligns with what is most physically advantageous for gymnasts in real life.

# Controls
Controls are explained on our start page, but to reiterate them:

Holding Z, X, C and/or V + using the left and right arrow keys will move the respective figures in the +/-z direction.

Pressing ``space'' will release all of the figures from the bar.

Pressing ``M'' will return you to the menu, pressing ``R'' will reset the scene.
